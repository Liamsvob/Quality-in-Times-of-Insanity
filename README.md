Quality in Times of Insanity: a Study of Quality Factor Investment Strategies in Stressed Markets

*Abstract*
This thesis explores the flight-to-quality phenomenon in financial markets and investigates systematic equity investment strategies using a quality style factor to achieve portfolio resilience and potentially outperform the market during periods of stress. 

The findings first highlight the existence of a quality factor portfolio that exhibits a negative correlation with the market, particularly during challenging market conditions. Thereafter, indicators with significant correlations to market returns and an inverse relationship with the quality factor portfolio are identified. Finally, we show that using these indicators to uncover two distinct market regimes with varying risk profiles and switching between the market portfolio and the quality factor yields superior risk-adjusted returns than the two portfolios alone.

This research offer insights for risk management and portfolio optimization, providing financial practitioners with strategies to navigate market turbulence effectively. However, limitations such as the specific dataset used and the assumption of stationary market dynamics should be considered. Further research can refine the selection of quality metrics, explore additional indicators and investigate regime detection methodologies more thoroughly to enhance the applicability and robustness of the findings.
